 * 1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
 * 2. We send them to Google's login page
 * 3. User logs in with their Google account
 * 4. Google sends them back to us with a "permission slip"
 * 5. We trade that permission slip for special keys to access their calendar
 * 6. We give them a "membership card" (JWT token) to use our app
