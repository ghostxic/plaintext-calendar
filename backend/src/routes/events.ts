 * - Creating new events in Google Calendar
 * - Processing natural language input to create events
 * - Checking NLP service status
 * 
 * Think of this as the "Event Planning Department" that:
 * 1. Shows you your schedule
 * 2. Adds new appointments to your calendar
 * 3. Understands when you say "meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
 * 4. Checks if you're free at that time
